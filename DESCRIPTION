Title: Delineates Ecologically-Defined Buffers Around Target Conservation Areas
Version: 2.0.0
Author: Bradley W. Compton
Maintainer: Bradley W. Compton <bcompton@umass.edu>
Description: #' Delineates ecologically-defined buffers around target conservation 
    areas using resistant kernels. Given conservation areas of interest ('seeds'),
    and a resistant surface (either one or more rasters or a landcover and 
    table with a resistance for each class), eco.buffer builds resistant kernel
    polygons or rasters around each seed to delineate areas of conservation
    interest for seeds. Seeds may be point, line, or polygon shapefiles, 
    typically delineating known locations for species of concern, rare
    ecological communities, or conservation cores.
